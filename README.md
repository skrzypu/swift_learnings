# swift_learnings

These are projects which I'm using to learn and check some ideas and things.

## AAPODAI => Another APOD AI app

I'm using APOD API as I like it. During development I can work with real data and get interesting knowledge.

This app is created to check how to work with TCA (https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture ). 

It has many shortcuts to check exactly what I need.
